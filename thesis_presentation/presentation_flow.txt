Today's Internet is slow.  It is.  We don't watch videos on the Internet because it is slow.

I'll show you how it happens (pictures).

This is very frustrating to today's work flow, and hard.

Add a picture of being force to pick between BitTorrent and normal (and picking BitTorrent and it being slower LOL).

a live demo (a recorded demo as a backup)


"today's bottleneck is no longer the disk--it's the network!"

slide: setting up BT is a pain

slide: Coral can't scale either (?)

slide: future work: privacy



slide: here's what you can do currently (and problems): BT.

stuff from the thesis itself: (pics mostly... [?])
