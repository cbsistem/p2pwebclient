It allows only a few peers to connect to a central seed at a time, allowing those connected to the seed to download unique, rare blocks quickly and begin to share them, thus decreasing the overall download time.  Unfortunately they assume well-connected peers and poorly connected seeds, and therefore fail to discover what makes their download system faster than BitTorrent (which it is).",

Each node is a member of several DHT rings representing nodes who are within certain proximity of it (and to each other).  It creates these rings with expanding size--i.e. DHT for nodes within 100ms, and one within 500ms, and one with global scope.  Members first query the DHT of nodes close to them, then the next ring up, then the next, until they find a node that has cached the file, or it is not found.  This allows them to use DHT queries for 'close' nodes, first (reducing latency), and to contact members who are close.  Coral does well in finding local copies of files quickly.  Coral relies on a central access point for redirection, and does not have automatic fall over to swarming download, though it does have excellent locality properties. Coral pages are 'cached' by accessing a url like http://outside.page.nyud.net:8090/subdir/pagename."
