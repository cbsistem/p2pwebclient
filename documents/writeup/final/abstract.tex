\section {Abstract}
In the traditional web client-server model, when the number of clients increases, available server bandwidth decreases.  This can cause servers to serve files slowly or to become completely overloaded.  Our protocol counters this by integrating peer-to-peer swarming with traditional client-server downloads.  Clients initially attempt to download the original file.  If this is too slow, they ask their peers for pieces of the file, and then begin to offer those pieces to other peers.
