\section {Abstract}
In traditional web client-server downloads, when the number of clients increases, the available server bandwidth decreases.  This causes servers to become overloaded or to serve files slowly.  This proposal addresses this problem by integrating peer-to-peer swarming with traditional client-server downloads.  Clients initially attempt to download the original file.  If this is too slow, they ask their peers for pieces of the file, and then begin to offer those pieces to other peers.
