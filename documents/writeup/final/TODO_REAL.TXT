====================actually really todo (in order of priority):

rewrite whole thing
add titles to that one graph

named arguments, does it with with 1.9.2?
start re-running stuffs

ummm....dr was a "broken" test basically

dw is the one we used with a "bad" server [too fast!]

"real" formatting

profile single run

appendix with tons
appendix with one
appendix with "real future"

double check 20% note

---------------------------later todo (unordered): possibly never

there was a future_work file (doc?) in the proposal...useful?

You might try running at lower loads.  Maybe at a really low load,
then dR becomes a factor.

an opendht why do you stink test

do a test against apache with 4 max. (large file)

%% ltodo: compare ilab3/4 dw with opendht few, dw with opendht many (i.e. an opendht test)

%% todo add a picture showing 'this was basically useless, anyway!  count(dt) versus count(dr)'
%% ltodo: add a "percent T, percent R, percent normal" graph, per multiples run.

%% TODO uh...are we tracing the right line in our graphs?
%% todo better colors! what the heck? (5 of them!)
%% lodo logarithmic scale option graph (work off the new code base :P)
%%
%% TODO profile a single single run in depth.


%% TODO server speed test...check the proposal first though :)
%% TODO make sure I use all my results' pics (one from each dir)

%% ltodo: why does my large test have 20s DHT's? What in the world?
%% ltodo fix large file transfer :) (backoff the origin, I'd wager)--
%% LODO appendix with buckets and buckets of pics

-- after thesis
release a faster ruby [?]
Include one picture of 'naive' start to end scatter

a picture showing how with openDHT, a few keys really lag
