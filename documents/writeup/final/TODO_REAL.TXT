====================actually really todo (in order of priority):

methodology for each experiment, metrics for each


explain "vary T some odd outliers in there" (after done with processing run)



Fig. 8 the exact numbers "is starts at y, tapers off at x" "why aren't they taking advantage of the server now?" figure 8, too.

Fig. 9 (now 6)  "it goes up to 1 at x" and why are there outliers?  also only one block.  "Got part of it from the origin, then p2p kicks in." and "it's only one block"



Section VII describe methodology "approximatley 5x the origin's bandwidth" confusing, single block small file.

then run it until they finish, throwing out the really long tail for a few.


Fig. 10 "T doesn't matter much"


"as long as T is bigger than this and R is bigger than this then doesn't matter"

load (Peers per Second)

DHT Removal time (seconds)

"how did I get figure 14?"


if 13, 14 go together, make 13 a, b

state how long you repeat each experiment.

table for section 9.

------------maybe don't have to? --------------------


ummm....dr was a "broken" test basically

dw is the one we used with a "bad" server [too fast!]

"real" formatting

profile single run

double check 20% note

appendix with tons
appendix with one
appendix with "real future"

---------------------------later todo (unordered): possibly never
%% TODO could put in some cool graphs of a single run of p2p vs. cs--at least the first few files that is quite interesting :)
%% TODO we never got the stats for > 25 peers/s for yanc transfer
%% TODO re run this p2p load test--how did we get such dang good DHT times?
there was a future_work file (doc?) in the proposal...useful?

You might try running at lower loads.  Maybe at a really low load,
then dR becomes a factor.

an opendht why do you stink test

do a test against apache with 4 max. (large file)

%% ltodo: compare ilab3/4 dw with opendht few, dw with opendht many (i.e. an opendht test)

%% todo add a picture showing 'this was basically useless, anyway!  count(dt) versus count(dr)'
%% ltodo: add a "percent T, percent R, percent normal" graph, per multiples run.

%% TODO uh...are we tracing the right line in our graphs?
%% todo better colors! what the heck? (5 of them!)
%% lodo logarithmic scale option graph (work off the new code base :P)
%%
%% TODO profile a single single run in depth.


%% TODO server speed test...check the proposal first though :)
%% TODO make sure I use all my results' pics (one from each dir)

%% ltodo: why does my large test have 20s DHT's? What in the world?

% ltodo: a single test with 20 blocks that shows "hey one block is dirt slow!"

%% vltodo fix large file transfer :) (backoff the origin, I'd wager--but how really?)--

-- after thesis
release a faster compiled version of ruby
