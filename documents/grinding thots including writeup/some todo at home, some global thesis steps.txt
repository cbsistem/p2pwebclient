ruby-proc on the timeself

PL
"first run -> fix it so it works 'normally well' [run it against C/S, bug fixing]
then optimize (two optimizations promised -- few on the original host, kill slow peer)
then examine it intricately
then compare it to BT (the 'basic' experiment)..."


free time (school/home):
better listener...flexible peer
todo's
