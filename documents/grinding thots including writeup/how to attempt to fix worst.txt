Assuming it 'is' getting cpu action, it might be waiting forever on slow outbound links 'blocking IO' to write
so try it 'with just threads p2p' (no p2p action) -- is it now consistent?
If so, then lower chunk size, sleep 0 on server


This assumes that a blocking write will 'interrupt' a read or what not, whether in openDHT or in a p2p download.
