real todo optimizations:
+somehow just get the 'end' 16K chunks or what not, of blocks [bool to download function?] 'you HAVE to download that chunk, and quickly' 

duplicated chunks with streaming req's would be the best (lodo + "keep alive the connection," "pre-streamed" style stuff)

lodo +server limited conn's
