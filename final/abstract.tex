\section {Abstract}
For traditional web servers, available bandwidth decreases as the number of clients increases.  
This can cause servers to serve files slowly or to become completely overwhelmed when load grows too high.
BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer solution to this problem, but it requires manual configuration for each
file to be delivered this way.
We develop a new system that integrates peer-to-peer file delivery with traditional client-server downloads.  
Clients initially attempt to download a file from a web server; if this is too slow, they transition to peer-to-peer
delivery.  Experiments with a prototype system show that it serves up to 30x faster than traditional web servers.
