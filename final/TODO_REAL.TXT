====================actually really todo (in order of priority):


redo the dR one--it had a *way* too low dT! [and was "broken" because of other reasons, as well, I believe] in process

redo: vary block size again--uh...we should be getting better medians than 30s for 100KB blocks. !!!


------------maybe don't have to? --------------------

if 13, 14 go together, make 13 a, b

%LTODO note unfairness: vr_multiples_tak_1 client upload sum. wow.

ummm....dr was a "broken" test basically

appendix with tons [?]
appendix with one, single run [?]
appendix with "real future"

with start and end times, can I find a correlation (30MB)

CDF for "percent from peers" for the BitTorrent download. [fix axes]

profile single run, include here.

%% TODO could put in some cool graphs of a single run of p2p vs. cs--at least the first few files that is quite interesting :)
%% TODO we never got the stats for > 25 peers/s for yanc transfer
%% TODO re run this p2p load test--how did we get such dang good DHT times?

You might try running at lower loads.  Maybe at a really low load,
then dR becomes a factor.

an opendht how you do stink test

%% ltodo: compare ilab3/4 dw with opendht few, dw with opendht many (i.e. an opendht test)

%% todo add a picture showing 'this was basically useless, anyway!  count(dt) versus count(dr)'
%% ltodo: add a "percent T, percent R, percent normal" graph, per multiples run.

%% TODO uh...are we tracing the right line in our graphs?
%% todo better colors! what the heck? (5 of them!)
%% lodo logarithmic scale option graph (work off the new code base :P)
%%
%% TODO profile a single single run in depth.


%% TODO server speed test...check the proposal first though :)
%% TODO make sure I use all my results' pics (one from each dir)

%% ltodo: why does my large test have 20s DHT's? What in the world?

% ltodo: a single test with 20 blocks that shows "hey one block is dirt slow!"

%% vltodo fix large file transfer :) (backoff the origin, I'd wager--but how really?)--
do a test against apache with 4 max. (large file)
