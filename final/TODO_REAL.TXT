====================actually really todo (in order of priority):

conclusion that rox/edit the other sections
restart "many many p2p" why was it so fast compared to my R and T tests?

------------maybe don't have to? --------------------

examine yanc 30MB -- why slow?



fix it to only one on the origin! yes! why? (if I ever redo something with multiple blocks)


%LTODO note unfairness: vr_multiples_tak_1 client upload sum. wow. [FUTURE WORK?]

appendix with tons of stuff [?]
appendix with one, single run [?]

-- probably never --

add a stat on how much overall was wasted...oh wait you can calculate that anyway though...hmm...

with start and end times, can I find a correlation (30MB)

%% TODO could put in some cool graphs of a single run of p2p vs. cs--at least the first few files that is quite interesting :)
%% TODO we never got the stats for > 25 peers/s for yanc transfer

an opendht how you do stink test

%% ltodo: why does my large test have 20s DHT's? What in the world?

% ltodo: a single test with 20 blocks that shows "hey one block is dirt slow!"

%% vltodo fix large file transfer :) (backoff the origin, I'd wager--but how really?)--
do a test against apache with 4 max. (large file)
