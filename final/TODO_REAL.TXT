====================actually really todo (in order of priority):

------------maybe don't have to? --------------------

note: no intelligent peer selection


do a 30 MB run with a single cheater or something like that. Yeah.

add a "real" comparison graph, since it was so popular in the pres.

re-run initial test with "optimal" discovered params.




also is BT slow *only* because of lack of seeds, or is it also the warmup phase (if the latter, that's another reason why things
should change and BT isn't a good fit for small files).

empirical, real world tests that BT is slower for OO downloads, like "it really is" (even for openoffice, a relatively )

note: system can be gamed quite easily currently, I'd imagine (even destructively)

note: some new goals from the presentation, really.  I think (?)

note: a run with more linger time for the vs. BT run (yeah).

note: this happens anytime the sum of the client exceeds the server's, or when far away.

examine yanc 30MB -- why slow?

fix it to only one on the origin! yes! why? (if I ever redo something with multiple blocks)

show: the startling difference between 20 and 60s linger for a stress run [whoa].

show: how does DHT latency increase with time? Is it 4 seconds or 60 that you want? huh?

-- probably never --

appendix with tons of stuff [?]
appendix with one, single run [?]

%LTODO note unfairness: vr_multiples_tak_1 client upload sum. wow. [FUTURE WORK?]

add a stat on how much overall was wasted...oh wait you can calculate that anyway though...hmm...

with start and end times, can I find a correlation (30MB)

%% TODO could put in some cool graphs of a single run of p2p vs. cs--at least the first few files that is quite interesting :)

%% TODO we never got the stats for > 25 peers/s for yanc transfer

an opendht how you do stink test

%% ltodo: why does my large test have 20s DHT's? What in the world?

% ltodo: a single test with 20 blocks that shows "hey one block is dirt slow!"

%% vltodo fix large file transfer :) (backoff the origin, I'd wager--but how really?)--
do a test against apache with 4 max. (large file)
