Roger's Thesis project (BYU).

This project allows you to download any arbitrary internet file, then share it among your peers--kind of like an instant bittorrent for any arbitrary file. 

How to get it to work:
gem install eventmachine
then ruby ./long_running_proxy.rb

then request files from http://localhost:8000/host_name/file_name.whatever and it will instantly share with those those who have already downloaded it!

Doesn't really work yet, sorry--still in the research/development phase, not release/production phase.  Subject to future/massive changes.  If interested chat me through github.
