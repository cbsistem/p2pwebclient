Roger's Thesis project (BYU).

This project allows you to download any arbitrary internet file, then share it among your peers--kind of like an instant bittorrent for any arbitrary file. 

How to get it to work:

Doesn't really work yet, sorry--still in the research/development phase, not release/production phase.  Subject to future/massive changes.  If interested chat me through github.

Competitors: google web accelerator, dijjer. Related: bittorrent, getright.  See the writeup for lots of others.
