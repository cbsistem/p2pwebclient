File#to_path is also an alias to File#path. These have been backported.

== Version 1.7.1 - August 20, 2009

Enumerable#take and Enumerable#first(n) are now returning as soon as possible. Previously, #each was yielding one element too many. See redmine issue #1554.

== Version 1.7 - May 27, 2009

Porting all 1.8.7 features to rubinius was quite enlightening (http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2009/05/schizo-ruby-puzzle.html ).
Many improvements were made to be consistent with MRI, e.g. converting arguments using to_int if needed, etc...
The changes are now reflected in 'backports'.

Some IO and ARGF methods were missing and are now complete.

== Version 1.6.6 - April 30, 2009

Important bug fix. String#gsub is left alone until I find a good way to modify it.

== Version 1.6 - April 29, 2009

Completed backport to 1.8.7.
